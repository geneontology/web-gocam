      <h2 class="heading-secondary">What is a simple GO annotation ?</h2>
      <p>
        A simple GO annotation is a gene product associated to a GO term, using an
        <a href="http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Guide_to_GO_Evidence_Codes" target="blank">evidence code</a> and a supporting reference (a primary research article, for example). The GO term may come from
        any of the three aspects of the GO:
        <a href="http://geneontology.org/page/molecular-function-ontology-guidelines" target="blank">Molecular Function</a> (MF),
        <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/page/biological-process-ontology-guidelines" target="blank">Biological Process</a> (BP), or
        <a href="http://geneontology.org/page/cellular-component-ontology-guidelines" target="blank">Cellular Component</a> (CC). Gene products can correspond to proteins, complexes, or non-coding RNAs, and must be
        represented by a stable identifier. Gene identifiers may serve as representative of one or more gene products. The
        following is an illustration of a GO annotation:

      <h2 class="heading-secondary">What is a GO-CAM model ?</h2>
      <p>
        A GO-CAM model is a combination of simple GO annotations to produce a network of annotations ("model"). Minimally, a model
        must connect at least two simple annotations. The primary unit of biological modeling, or annotation, in GO-CAM is
        a molecular activity, e.g. protein kinase activity, of a specific gene product or complex. A molecular activity is
        an activity carried out at the molecular level by a gene product; this is specified by a term from the GO MF ontology.
        GO-CAM models are thus connections of GO MF annotations enriched by providing the appropriate context in which that
        function occurs. All connections in a GO-CAM model, e.g. between a gene product and activity, two activities, or
        an activity and additional contextual information, are made using clearly defined semantic relations from the Relations
        Ontology.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Providing context for molecular activities</h2>
      <p>
        One major difference between simple annotations and GO-CAM models is that the former does not have explicit relations between
        the gene product being annotated and the GO term. In GO-CAM models, using defined, semantic relations allows us to
        capture how a gene product’s molecular function relates to other aspects of GO. GO-CAM explicitly defines the relationships
        between:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"> different aspects (MF, BP, CC) of each gene product as defined in GO</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"> the combined functions of different gene products (“pathways”), and </li>
        <li style="list-style-type: decimal;"> different systems of interacting functions (“modules”).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A molecular activity may act upon another “target” molecule, this can be specified using a gene product identifier (for a
        protein or a gene) or a term from the ChEBI ontology (for a small molecule). In this case the MF is qualified with
        "has input [target_id]". A molecular activity occurs in a location: this includes cellular structures (described
        by a GO CC class (i.e. term), excluding the “macromolecular complex” branch), which can be further nested within
        larger structures using the appropriate cell and anatomy ontologies. a molecular activity is part of (i.e. helps
        to accomplish) a biological process, i.e. a biological program that also includes other molecular activities, which
        is described by a GO BP class (i.e. term). In turn, a biological process can be nested inside an even larger biological
        process. if the molecular activity occurs during a particular biological phase (e.g. a particular stage in organism
        development), this can be specified using a term from an appropriate ontology; i.e. any descendant of the term “GO:0044848
        biological phase”. a molecular activity may also have upstream, causal roles with respect to a process, "acts upstream
        of" or its precise relationship to a process may not yet be known, in which case the relation would be "acts upstream
        of or within". Each of these relations may further be qualified by indicating a positive or negative effect, e.g.
        "acts upstream of, positive effect".

      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Linking different molecular activities</h2>
      <p>
        Once the GO-CAM unit has been created (MF + BP + CC), these different units can be linked to each other to represent a Causal
        Activity Model. The most common relations are directly (positively/negatively) regulates and provides input for,
        but there are other relations of greater and lesser specificity, depending on what is known. Regulates should be
        used to denote biological control of a downstream activity. Provides input for should be used when there is no control,
        but an upstream function creates a molecular entity that is the target of the downstream function, such as in a metabolic
        pathway.

      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Incomplete GO-CAMs</h2>
      <p>
        We recognize that the knowledge of biology is incomplete; in cases where some or most of these aspects are unknown, a model
        may still be constructed with details added as more information becomes available. Users should attempt to specify
        functions as fully as possible, but partial models are expected and still contribute to the GO knowledgebase.
