      <h2 class="heading-secondary">What is a standard GO annotation ?</h2>
      <p>
        A standard GO annotation is a gene product associated to a GO term, using an
        <a href="http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Guide_to_GO_Evidence_Codes" target="blank">evidence code</a> and a supporting reference (a primary research article, for example). The GO term may come from
        any of the three aspects of the GO:
        <a href="http://geneontology.org/page/molecular-function-ontology-guidelines" target="blank">Molecular Function</a> (MF),
        <a href="http://www.geneontology.org/page/biological-process-ontology-guidelines" target="blank">Biological Process</a> (BP), or
        <a href="http://geneontology.org/page/cellular-component-ontology-guidelines" target="blank">Cellular Component</a> (CC). Gene products can correspond to proteins, complexes, or non-coding RNAs, and must be
        represented by a stable identifier. Gene identifiers may serve as representative of one or more gene products. The
        following is an illustration of a GO annotation:

      <h2 class="heading-secondary">What is a GO-CAM model ?</h2>
      <p>
        A GO-CAM model is a combination of standard GO annotations to produce a network of annotations ("model"), that is a more complete model of biological function than the separate annotations. For example, a GO-CAM can represent how the activities of different gene products work together in a pathway or “biological program.” GO-CAM models can connect different pieces of information about the function of a gene product (joining together different annotations for the same gene product), and/or can connect functions of different gene products together by specifying how the activity of one gene product can affect the activity of another gene product. All connections in a GO-CAM model are made using clearly defined semantic relations from the <a href="http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/ro.html" target="blank">Relations Ontology</a>.

      </p>
    </section>


    <section class="u-margin-bottom-small">
      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Relating annotations for the same gene product, from different aspects of GO</h2>
      <p>
        One major difference between standard annotations and GO-CAM models is that the former does not have explicit relations between
        the gene product being annotated and the GO term. In GO-CAM models, using defined, semantic relations allows us to
        capture how a gene product’s molecular function relates to other aspects of GO. Specifically, in GO-CAM a gene product’s
        activity <a href="http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/RO?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FBFO_0000066" target="blank">occurs_in</a> a specific cellular component, meaning that gene product is active in that cellular component
        (the meaning of a standard GO cellular component annotation). In GO-CAM a gene product’s activity is executed as
        <a href="http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/RO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050" target="blank">part_of</a> a larger biological process (biological program) which is the meaning of a standard GO biological process
        annotation. In turn, a biological process can be nested inside an even larger biological process.

      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Linking different molecular activities</h2>
      <p>
        Once the GO-CAM unit has been created (MF + BP + CC), these different units can be linked to each other (via the molecular
        activity) to represent a Causal Activity Model. The most common relations are directly (<a href="http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/RO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002629" target="blank">positively</a> / <a href="http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/RO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002630" target="blank">negatively</a>) regulates
        and <a href="http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/RO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002413" target="blank">directly provides input for</a>, but there are other relations of greater and lesser specificity, depending on what
        is known. Regulates should be used to denote biological control of a downstream activity. Provides input for should
        be used when there is no control, but an upstream function creates a molecular entity that is the target of the downstream
        function, such as in a metabolic pathway.

      <p>
        We recognize that the knowledge of biology is incomplete; in cases where some or most of these aspects are unknown, a model
        may still be constructed with details added as more information becomes available. Users should attempt to specify
        functions as fully as possible, but partial models are expected and still contribute to the GO knowledgebase.

      <h2 class="heading-secondary">Converting GO-CAMs to standard GO annotations</h2>
      <p>
        GO-CAMs can be “decomposed” into the standard GO annotations (connecting a gene product to a single GO term) that they are
        constructed from. This is accomplished in two ways. The first way is to simply take the GO terms that are connected
        to a gene product via a defined chain of relations. Specifically, for molecular function annotations, the decomposition
        starts with the MF (the activity, which is central), and follows the enabled_by edge to the gene product (or complex).
        For cellular component, it starts with the MF and then traces through enabled_by to get the gene product, and from
        MF through occurs_in to get the cellular component; biological process is similar except that it traces from MF through
        part_of to get the biological process (and more than one part_of if the process is nested inside a larger process).
        The second way is to apply logical reasoning to infer additional GO terms that are not explicitly in the model, but
        can be inferred from logical definitions (“equivalence axioms”) in the ontology. For instance, if a protein binding
        activity is enabled by a gene product, and that activity has a directly_regulates relationship to a protein kinase
        activity, the reasoner can infer that the protein binding activity also meets the definition of the GO term protein
        kinase activator activity, and that standard annotation will also be made.

      <h3 class="heading-tertiary">Software</h3>
      <p>
        Code handling the export of standard GO annotations from a GO-CAM model is provided by the
        <a href="https://github.com/geneontology/minerva/" target="blank">Minerva software</a>, which is the data handling backend for Noctua. This code extracts an initial set of proposed
        standard GO annotations from a model, and then applies filters ensuring that appropriate metadata, such as an ECO
        evidence code, is obtained for each annotation.
